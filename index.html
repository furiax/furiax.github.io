                <p>At the age of 18, when I went to high school, I came in contact with programming for the first time.<br>
                    Back then, I learned the basics of C++, Java, Visual Basic, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL.<br>
                    <br>
                    About 20 years later, during corona, I picked up programming again, this time focusing on C# and its various .NET frameworks.<br>
                    What started out as a hobby to pass time soon became a daily practice, and I found myself enjoying coding more each day.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now, I've reached a point where I want to take the next step and become a professional .NET developer.<br>
                    <br>
                    I've learned most through self-study and by building various projects.<br>

                        The course was rather slow and covered the very basics in the begining so I also followed a Javascript course on FreeCodeCamp. Today I achieved the JavaScript Certificate on FreeCodeCamp.

                        I started out making some ASP.NET core applications making use of MVC and razor pages.
                        In early 2024, I tried some Angular. I've built an app that tracks coffee consumption using plain Angular. And later a sleep tracker, here I made use of Angular Material library.
                        And now April 2024, I'm starting on authentication and authorization.
                        I'm currently also exploring working with Azure.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm">
                        As a beginner, I started out with the console projects on the website.
                        The first few projects were pretty basic and were quite easy and fast to complete.
                        But with each project, the difficulty rose and the requirements became more demanding.
                        I learned about CRUD commands and how to work with different databases.
                        First, using raw SQL commands before using ORMS like Entity Framework or Dapper. So we got a good understanding of what happens behind using ORM's
                        It started out simple with only one table, but I also learned to work with more complex data when you have multiple linked tables.
                        The next topic were API's. How to consume an external API and then how to build API's myself.
                        I learned to make use of third-party NuGet packages.
                        I built a phonebook app that didn't only store contact data could also send an SMS or mail to the contacts with Twilio.
                        Furthermore, I made an app that collected sports results through web scrapping and then used this data to send the users an automated email each day with the sports results.
                        I learned how to read and convert data from different data sources(xls, csv, pdf, doc,..) and use this data in a project. One of the apps I build gets data from an Excel file and stores this data in a database.
                        Other important topics I learned about were debugging, Unit Testing and making use of GitHub.
                        By September 2023, I had completed all twelve console projects, and with this completed, the back-end part was done.
                        Around September, Microsoft also made a free Foundational C# Certificate available through FreeCodeCamp. This became my first certification.

                    <p class="text-sm">This website has been a real game changer for me and was exactly what I was looking for. A special thanks to Pablo for running this great website is in order. 
                        It offered a complete roadmap from beginner to advanced .NET developer.
                        I really liked how the academy was focused on learning through building projects yourself.
                        I liked the fact that it uses the hands-on approach.
                        It basically offers information about a certain topic and then you get an assignment. So you have to put it into practice by building a project that must meet some requirements and challenges.
                        Once you are done building the project, you can then send it up for review by the owner. He then gives feedback on where to improve. </p>

                    <p class="text-sm italic">Published on: 01/04/2023</p>
                    <p class="text-sm">In September 2022, I read an article in 'De Gazet' (an internal magazine for employees of Colruyt Group) about employees who got re-schooled internally to become developers.
                        Reading this sparked something inside me and made me start programming again after all these years.
                        I tried to find some more information about the reschooling at work. But it was limited, and they weren't immediately looking for more people.
                        So I decided to look for other options.
                        I considered distance learning or evening schooling, but the combination of them with work and private life didn't seem manageable.
                        So I started with self-learning at my own pace.
                        My searchresults were quickly picked up by Google and Meta, and my social media were flooded with programming-related advertisements.
                        One of the adds was a 90% reduction course for building a flight booking app with ASP.NET and Angular.
                        I started with the course but realized very soon that this was way out of my league.
                        So I first found myself some basic C# course to complete.
                        After that, I got my hands on Tim Corey's C# Mastercourse and also the book "The C# Player Guide" which both gave me insight on more advanced topics.
                        This got me busy until April 2023, then I discovered the website thecsharpacademy.com through a link on Reddit.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm">I first came into contact with programming back in secondary school, 20 years ago, and was immediately fascinated by it.
                        We learned to write some very basic commands to control a small car. This tasted like more.
                        So after I finished secondary school, I decided to learn more about IT.
                        So I went to the 'Katholieke Hogeschool Mechelen' and studied 'Informatie Management and Support' for three years.
                        This direction was a mix of business management and IT. Although I liked the IT part, I was struggling with the business management side. Which resulted in me not finishing my studies.
                        During these three years, I came in touch with a wide variety of IT skills. We learned some web design (HTML, CSS, Javascript), programming (C++, Java, Visual Basic), database management (SQL) and networking (CISCO).
                        I couldn't immediately find any work that was IT related back then, so I started doing various jobs, ending up at Colruyt, where I still work today.</p>
